The KQBF (knapsack quadractic binary function) instances should be read with the assumption that the matrix of coefficients is a triangular superior matrix, i.e., all elements below the diagonal are zero. The instance data is organized as follows:

<N, instance dimension, number of binary variables>
<W, knapsack capacity>
<w1> <w2> ... <wN>
<a11> <a12> ... <a1N>
<a22> ... <a2N>

<aNN>
